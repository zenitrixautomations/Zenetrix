      { q: 'What is a UHF RFID controller?', a: 'It is the control unit and software that receives tag IDs from the long-range reader, decides whether the vehicle is allowed in, and signals the boom barrier or gate to open. It also stores the entry and exit records.' },
      { q: 'Is the reader enough, or do I also need the controller and software?', a: 'The reader only reads the tag. For a proper system with a user list, blocking of lost tags, validity periods and reports, you need the controller and software. For a very small gate, a simple reader-to-barrier connection may be enough.' },
      { q: 'Can one controller manage more than one gate?', a: 'Yes, systems can be arranged to manage several entries and exits from one software, depending on the controller and licence supplied. Tell us the number of gates and lanes for the quote.' },
      { q: 'Can I see who entered and when?', a: 'Yes. Each pass is logged with date, time, gate and tag, and the log can be searched and exported for audits, complaints or billing.' },
      { q: 'How do I block a lost tag or an old resident?', a: 'The tag is disabled in the software, so it no longer opens any gate. A new tag is then issued to the new vehicle or resident.' },
      { q: 'Will it work with the boom barrier or gate I already have?', a: 'Often yes, if the existing operator accepts a standard dry-contact or access input. Share the make and model and we check compatibility on the site visit.' },
      { q: 'Does it need internet?', a: 'Gate control normally runs on the local controller and PC, so entry does not depend on internet. Internet is only needed if you want remote viewing or cloud backup.' },
      { q: 'Who supports the software after installation?', a: 'Zenitrix provides installation, training and service. Ask about an AMC that covers readers, controller, barrier and software together.' },

    headline: 'Conveyor high speed door for production lines in Hyderabad',
    intro: 'A conveyor high speed door is a compact roll-up fabric door built for the opening where a conveyor belt carries product from one room to another. It opens fast when product arrives and closes straight after, so temperature, dust, insects and air movement between the two rooms stay under control while the line keeps running.',
    features: [
      'Compact size for conveyor and pass-through openings, up to 2000 mm wide and 2000 mm high',
      'Adjustable opening speed up to 2 m/s and closing speed up to 0.5 m/s',
      'Flexible fabric curtain, 0.9 to 1.5 mm thick, that gives way safely if it is touched',
      'Electronic limit switch as standard, so travel limits are set precisely',
      'Crank handle for emergency opening in a power cut',
      'For internal or external use, with IP 54 protection for the operator and IP 65 for the control',
      'Optional bottom-edge safety sensor and radar sensor',
      'Built to EN 13241-1 security standard',

      { h: 'Product approaches', p: 'A sensor, light grid or signal from the conveyor controller tells the door that product is coming. The door starts to open before the product reaches the opening.' },
      { h: 'The curtain rolls up', p: 'A motor lifts the flexible fabric curtain at an adjustable speed. The opening is only as large as the product needs, so air exchange between rooms stays small.' },
      { h: 'Product passes', p: 'The conveyor carries the product through. A safety sensor or light grid watches the opening so that the door never closes on product or a person.' },
      { h: 'The door closes', p: 'Once the opening is clear, the door closes at a controlled speed. If the curtain is hit, it is designed to come out of its guides and can be reset without major damage.' },

      { q: 'What size can a conveyor high speed door be?', a: 'The model supplied by Zenitrix handles openings up to 2000 mm wide and 2000 mm high. For larger openings we suggest a standard high speed door.' },
      { q: 'How does the door know when to open?', a: 'It can take a signal from the conveyor controller, a radar sensor or a light grid. We choose the trigger that suits your line.' },
      { q: 'Can the door be used outside?', a: 'The model is rated for internal and external use, with IP 54 protection for the operator and IP 65 for the control. Wind and weather exposure are checked on site.' },
