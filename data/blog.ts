    description: 'A plain-language guide to sliding gate operators, racks, controllers and safety sensors, and what to check before you automate a gate.',
    sections: [
      { h: 'The main parts', p: ['An automatic sliding gate has four core parts: an operator (motor), a rack or chain along the gate, a control board and safety devices. The motor turns a pinion gear that meshes with the rack fixed to the gate, pushing the gate along its track or cantilever frame.', 'The control board receives commands from remotes, keypads, cards or a phone app, then starts and stops the motor. Limit switches or encoders tell it where the gate is.'] },
      { h: 'Safety devices', p: ['Photocells send an invisible beam across the opening and stop or reverse the gate if the beam is broken. Safety edges on the gate leaf do the same on contact. A flashing lamp warns people that the gate is about to move.'] },
      { h: 'What power cuts do', p: ['Most operators have a manual release so the gate can be pushed by hand. Some systems add a battery backup so the gate keeps working for a limited number of cycles. Ask which option suits your site.'] },
      { h: 'Before you automate', p: ['A gate that is heavy, bent or sticks on its track will wear out any motor. A good installer checks weight, alignment, ground level and side space first and fixes the gate if needed.'] },

    description: 'Compare sliding and swing automatic gates on space, safety, security, maintenance and look so you can pick the right one.',
    sections: [
      { h: 'Space decides most cases', p: ['A sliding gate needs clear space beside the opening roughly equal to the gate width. A swing gate needs clear space in front of or behind the opening for the leaves to open. Measure what you actually have before choosing.'] },
      { h: 'Safety and security', p: ['Both types need photocells and safety edges. A sliding gate moves along the boundary, so the hazard zone is mainly at the closing edge. A swing gate sweeps an arc, which needs more care where people or vehicles pass.'] },
      { h: 'Maintenance', p: ['Sliding gates depend on tracks, wheels and racks that need to be kept clean and aligned. Swing gates depend on hinges and arm joints that need lubrication and checking for wear.'] },
      { h: 'Our rule of thumb', p: ['Choose sliding where side space is available and the gate is wide or heavy. Choose swing where the design calls for it and there is room to open. A site survey gives the final answer.'] },

      { h: 'Fence and advertising arms', p: ['Fence-style arms deter people from walking under the arm. Advertising arms carry a message but catch more wind, so the plinth and structure need to be designed for it.'] },
